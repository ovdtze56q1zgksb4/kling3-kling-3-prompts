**Why teams call Kling 3.0 Turbo (`kling-3.0-turbo`) through APIMart**

- **One key, entire catalog.** The same `https://api.apimart.ai/v1` base URL and `Authorization` header reach Kling 3.0 Turbo (`kling-3.0-turbo`) and 300+ other image, video and language models — switch the `model` field, not your client.
- **Per-second billing.** A job is charged for the seconds it actually generates at the resolution you picked.
- **The charge comes back in the response.** Every completed task reports the amount billed (`cost` / `credits_cost`); a task marked `failed` is refunded.
- **Async by design.** Submit, take the `task_id`, poll `GET /v1/tasks/{id}` — batching and retries are ordinary queue work, not a bespoke integration.

Kling 3.0 Turbo is Kuaishou's fast text-to-video and image-to-video model with low latency and negative prompts.

## Model id and routes

| Route | `model` value | Billing | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text-to-video / image-to-video | `kling-3.0-turbo` | per generated second, by resolution | see the [model page](https://go.apimart.ai/k-b2b989) for the exact tiers |

Endpoint: `POST https://api.apimart.ai/v1/videos/generations` (OpenAI-compatible), then poll `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}`.

## Pricing

Prices are a snapshot; the [pricing page](https://go.apimart.ai/k-8f17d7) and [`data/model.json`](data/model.json) are refreshed by CI, and a completed task reports the exact amount in its `cost` field.

## Request parameters

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | string | required | the model id shown in the route table above |
| `prompt` | string | required | the shot description; camera and subject motion belong here |
| `duration` | integer | route default | clip length in seconds — billing is per generated second |
| `resolution` | string | route default | 480P / 720P / 1080P or the route’s own tiers |
| `size` / `aspect_ratio` | string | `16:9` | output framing |
| `image_urls` | string[] | — | first frame, first + last frame, or style references, where supported |
| `seed` | integer | — | fix the seed to reproduce a take |

The table lists the fields accepted by the APIMart OpenAI-compatible video endpoint. Check the [model page](https://go.apimart.ai/k-b2b989) for anything this model adds on top.

## Quickstart

```bash
curl --request POST --url https://api.apimart.ai/v1/videos/generations \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $APIMART_API_KEY" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"kling-3.0-turbo","prompt":"A bamboo forest at sunrise, slow push-in","duration":5,"resolution":"720P","size":"16:9"}'
```

```python
import os, time, requests

BASE = "https://api.apimart.ai/v1"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['APIMART_API_KEY']}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

created = requests.post(f"{BASE}/videos/generations", headers=HEADERS, timeout=60, json={
    "model": "kling-3.0-turbo", "prompt": "A bamboo forest at sunrise, slow push-in",
}).json()
task_id = created["data"]["id"]

while True:
    task = requests.get(f"{BASE}/tasks/{task_id}", headers=HEADERS, timeout=60).json()["data"]
    if task["status"] in ("completed", "failed"):
        break
    time.sleep(5)
print(task.get("cost"), task["result"]["videos"][0]["url"])
```

Runnable versions: [`examples/`](examples). The task lifecycle is `pending → processing → completed | failed`.
